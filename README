# Arduino
Make sure you install all libraries from the arduinoFw/libs directory.


# Processing

Version 1.5.1
Hint, the default librxtxSerial.jnilib will crash on osx, don't know why. I replaced the version (/Applications/Processing.app/Contents/Resources/Java/modes/java/libraries/serial/library/macosx/) with mine.


# Trace errors
* Replace power supply (impulsstrom issues)
* Use twistet pair cable?
* Use Teensy instead an Arduino
* Play with CPU setting for the LPD6803 (strip.setCPUmax(90))
* Common ground
* recheck cable
